# Google-Cloud-Capstone-Project
As part of the Google Cloud Cybersecurity Certificate, I completed a comprehensive capstone project simulating a real-world security incident at Cymbal Bank, a fictional financial institution. The project involved identifying and mitigating multiple cloud security vulnerabilities that led to a data breach. 

Key Components:

- Analyzing security findings using Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) to pinpoint misconfigurations and threats.

- Remediating exposed virtual machines by disabling unnecessary ports and enforcing secure boot protocols.

- Securing Cloud Storage buckets by implementing uniform bucket-level access controls and revoking public access.

- Adjusting firewall rules to limit ingress traffic and enhance network security.

- Verifying compliance with regulatory standards post-remediation.
